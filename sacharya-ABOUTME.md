# About Sankalp
Hello, and welcome to Convey Engineering. I'm so glad you chose to work with us!

It’s going to take a solid quarter to figure this place out. I understand the importance of first impressions, and I know you want to get a check in the win column, but this is a complex place full of equally complex humans. Take your time, meet everyone, go to every meeting, write things down, and ask all the questions – especially about all those baffling shipping and logistics industry acronyms, like "3PL" or "LTL".

One of the working relationships we need to define is ours. The following is intended to be a user guide to help you understand me and how I work. It captures what you can expect out of the average week working with me, how I like to work, my guiding precepts, and some of my, uh, more...  _nuanced_ qualities. My intent is to accelerate our working relationship with this document.<sup><a href="#note1" id="note1ref">[1]</a></sup>

## Our Average Week
We’ll have a 1:1 every week for at least 30 minutes, no matter what. I _want_ to hear from you, and while it's OK if we occasionally have to reschedule or cancel a meeting, I expect that we will meet at least 2-3 times a month. I expect us to hold each other mutually accountable to this guideline.

Our 1:1 meeting is your meeting, and you own the agenda. Ideally, we are focused on _you_, the human, not _you_ the staff member; ideally, we are discussing substantive topics, like things that are blocking you, ideas you have about how to make things better, things that make you unhappy about your work environment, general questions you might have, and so on.

Occasionally, I may ask about how a certain project is going, and occasionally, I may have topics I'm seeking your input on. _Occasionally..._ I may even inadvertently hijack your meeting. If you feel I'm taking over your meeting, please let me know, and I'll find a better way forward.

A final word on 1:1s – I like to be on time, but sometimes, the day will get away from me. Please do not take this to mean that your time is not important to me; if I'm not starting the meeting on time, you can certainly come and find me. Most often, I will drop what I'm doing to make the time for you.

You can Slack me 24 hours a day – I will often respond quickly, but sometimes I may not. It's OK to remind me that I haven't gotten back to you. I appreciate reminders from you.

I work a bit at night and on the weekends. This is my choice. **I do not expect that you are going to keep my hours.** I might Slack you things, but unless the thing says URGENT, it can always wait until work begins for you on Monday. I also expect you to hold me accountable when you feel the thing was not _actually_ URGENT.

## North Star Principles
**Humans first.** I believe that happy, informed, and productive humans build fantastic product. I care about the business, but I optimize for the humans. Other leaders will maximize the business, the technology, or any other number of important facets. Ideological diversity is key to an effective team. All perspectives are relevant, and we need all these leaders, but my bias is towards building productive humans, so that they can deliver superior business value.

**Leadership comes from everywhere.** As an engineer, I remain skeptical of managers, even though I myself am a manager. While I believe managers are an essential part of a scaling organization, I don’t believe they have a monopoly on leadership, and I work hard to build other constructs and opportunities in our teams for non-managers to effectively lead.

**I see things as systems.** I reduce all complex things (including humans) into systems. I think in terms of processes. I take great joy in attempting to understand how these systems and processes all fit together. When I see large or small inefficiencies in systems, I’d like to fix them with your help.

**It is important to me that humans are treated fairly.** I believe that most humans are trying to to do the right thing, but unconscious bias leads them astray. I work hard to understand and address my biases because I understand their ability to create inequity.

**I heavily bias towards action.** Long meetings where we are endlessly debating potential directions are sometimes valuable, but I believe starting is the best way to begin learning and make progress. This is not always the correct strategy. This strategy annoys those who like to debate.

**I believe in the compounding awesomeness of continually fixing small things.** I believe quality assurance is everyone’s responsibility and there are bugs to be fixed everywhere… all the time.

**Production code is not "mine" or "yours"; it is _ours_ to collectively own.** When code is under active development, the individual developing that code has ownership and is responsible for transforming it into usable software. However, once that code is in production, I believe we all have a shared and vested stake in repairing, improving, and refactoring it. I understand that some people like to have ownership over "their" code; I invite such folks to consider that in this case, I'll optimize for the collective, not the individual.

**I start with an assumption of positive intent for all involved.** This has worked out well for me over my career. 

## Feedback Protocol
I firmly believe that feedback is at the core of building trust and respect in a team.

I am a strong believer in a 3-dimensional view on individual performance. That is to say, feedback should come from oneself, from one's direct manager, and from one's peers. In my career, I've found that stitching together each of those dimensions produces a rich and holistic view about each person's strengths and areas for further development

At Convey, we've introduced a lightweight feedback cycle which occurs twice a year. I've worked with other leaders across the company to ensure that the review process we follow adheres to the premise of a 3D view of individuals.

Review periods are not the only time we’ll exchange feedback. This will be a recurring topic in our 1:1s. I am going to ask you for feedback in 1:1s periodically. I'm a human who strongly believes in growth, and I cannot do that without your help.

Disagreement is feedback and the sooner we learn how to efficiently disagree with each other, the sooner we’ll trust and respect each other more. Ideas don’t get better with agreement.

## Meeting Protocol
Before I became a manager, I would lament the mere concept of being stuck in meetings all day. As an engineer, I wasted a lot of time in poorly run meetings. As a manager, I _still_ wasted a lot of time in poorly run meetings. As an engineering-minded human, I recognize that our most precious and immutable commodity is time.

Recall that I think in systems and processes. To me, the most valuable meetings (i.e., those with successful outcomes) have a few key ingredients:
* A meeting organizer, who has articulated 3 things ahead of the meeting:
   * inputs into the meeting
   * agenda for the meeting
   * outputs from the meeting
* An appropriate number of active and invested particpants.
* A meeting leader (who need not not be the organizer), who will:
   * moderate a discussion per the agenda,
   * mine for disagreements (ideas don't better without them…),
   * and drive them to outcomes. The more we do this, the more fun (and valuable) our meetings will be.
* A recap of next steps – this can take many forms: verbal, documented, another meeting, etc.

I go to a lot of meetings. I deliberately run with my calendar publicly visible. If you have a question about a meeting on my calendar, ask me. If a meeting is private or confidential, its title and attendees will be hidden from your view. The vast majority of my meetings are neither private nor confidential.

If I am attending a meeting, I’d prefer starting on time. If I am running a meeting, I will do my best to start on time. If it’s not clear to me why I am in a meeting, I will ask for clarification on my attendance. If I start to discover in a meeting that my input is not sufficiently additive to the conversation, I may politely seek clarification and leave accordingly.

If you send me prep material (a presentation deck, a wiki page, etc.) a reasonable amount of time before a meeting (depending on the depth of the material and the timing of the meeting), I will read it in advance and prepare my questions for you. If I haven’t done my prep, I will tell you.

If a meeting completes its intended purpose before its scheduled end time, let’s give the time back to everyone. If it’s clear the intended goal won’t be achieved in the allotted time, let’s stop the meeting before time is up and determine how to finish the meeting later.

## Nuance and Errata

**I am an introvert** and that means that prolonged exposure to humans is exhausting for me. Weird, huh? I first discovered exactly _how_ exhausting this is when, in my early days as a manager, I would schedule all of my 1:1s for the same day. I no longer do this. If I'm not leading a meeting, and there's more than five of us in a room, you may find I become strangely quiet. Do not confuse my quiet with lack of engagement.

**When I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined** you should ask me for both clarification and a call on importance. I might still be brainstorming, and may not have considered all of the consequences of my ideas. These questions can save everyone a lot of time.

**I am an idealist and a dreamer, and often imagine what _could be_.** I've always loved building. That's what drew me to engineering – but often, the most exciting part to me is the imagining of what could be. Please don't confuse that for lack of pragmatism. I sometimes just get carried away.

**I love to start new things** but I often lose interest when I can mentally see how the thing is going to finish which might be weeks or month the thing is actually done. Sorry. I’m getting better at this.

**Humans who gossip** are a trigger for me.

<a id="note1" href="#note1ref">[1]</a>: Speculation: there is an idea in this document that you’d like your manager to do. Thesis: Just because I have a practice or a belief doesn’t mean it’s the right practice or belief for your manager. Suggestion: Ask your manager if they think my practice or belief is a good idea and see what happens. Feedback is a gift.
